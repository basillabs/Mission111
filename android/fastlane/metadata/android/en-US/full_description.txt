Storytelling is a social tradition that brings together cultures and communities. For this reason, Mission 111 has developed stories that have been used for years to help people engage with each other all over the world. The Story Share app brings that tool into your hands featuring twenty nine stories in three languages (English, Swedish, and Arabic).

This app was built by Basil Technologies in partnership with Mission 111.
